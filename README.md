## Core Principles

1. **Absolute Security** – Private keys are encrypted and retained locally; no sensitive data leaves the device unprotected. Transactions are validated through robust cryptography and consensus mechanisms, ensuring tamper-proof operation.  
2. **Transparent Value** – All wallet operations, including staking, transfers, and balances, are fully auditable and verifiable. SecWallet is designed for accountability at every level, reducing reliance on trust intermediaries.  
3. **Resilient Governance** – Protocol rules for token handling, staking, and network integration are predefined, auditable, and immutable, providing predictable and reliable economic behavior.  
4. **Wealth Preservation** – SecWallet emphasizes sustainable value creation through staking incentives, adoption-driven appreciation, and integration with trusted decentralized finance networks.
